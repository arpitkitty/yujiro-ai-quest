## License System - Quick Start

1) Generate keys (owner machine only)
- ES256 recommended:
  - openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -noout -out private-key.pem
  - openssl ec -in private-key.pem -pubout -out public-key.pem
- Replace client public key: copy your public-key.pem into src/lib/license/public-key.pem

2) Create a customer license
- node admin/generate-key.js --user=USER_123 --features='["premium","boss_mode"]' --expiry=2026-12-31 --key=path/to/private-key.pem
- Output: yujiro_license.json with { token, meta }

3) Create an OWNER license
- node admin/generate-owner-key.js --key=path/to/private-key.pem

4) Install the license
- Easiest: place yujiro_license.json at the web root so the app auto-discovers it
- Or in app: Unlock â†’ Upload license file or paste token

5) Optional revocation API
- Run: ts-node server/index.ts (or compile to JS)
- Revoke: node admin/revoke.js --nonce=abcd1234

Notes
- Verification is stateless and offline. Only the public key is shipped.
- Owner license (is_owner:true) unlocks all features regardless of expiry/features.
- Private key must NEVER be checked into your client app.
